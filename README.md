# Task Manager – To-Do List Application

This project is a simple To-Do List application. It allows users to add tasks and manage them through different categories such as Home, Completed, Pending, and Priority using a side menu.

The application focuses on a clean two-column layout and basic task management functionality. JavaScript is used for adding tasks dynamically and filtering tasks based on their status( priority, completed, pending)
